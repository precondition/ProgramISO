# Ideas that may or may not get added to ProgramISO

* Put french accented characters in a variant
* Put dead accents in another variant
 
* Variant where the first 2 levels of the number row are reversed
* Variant(?) with a 5th level set as a Latch on physical left shift key to access accented characters like on my old altgr-special+vladislav combo (Physical ctrl key(s) can be used to regain lost compose key. Same can be said for the menu key)
 
* Level3 M-Enter-Ctrl key could hold ;

# Ideas that may or may not get added to ProgramISO

* Put french accented characters in a variant
* Put dead accents in another variant
* Variant where the first 2 levels of the number row are reversed
* Variant(?) with a 5th level set as a Latch on physical left shift key to access accented characters like on my old unreleased prototype kb layouts. (Physical ctrl key(s) can be used to regain lost compose key. Same can be said for the menu key)
* Level3 M-Enter-Ctrl key could hold ;
* Possibly add a numpad centered on 'K' on a layer? This would require a switch because latch would be too impractical for entering digit**s**. A lock could be considered but I believe it would be overkill to use a lock just for numbers.
* [This project](https://gitlab.com/wsha/chorded_keymap) is an interesting concept. Not sure if it's feasible with xcape but using <kbd>F</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> as the chord has some potential (It's better than the default <kbd>D</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd>, which frequently come together: e.g. "towar**ds**", ...)
* Remap <kbd>Menu</kbd> or <kbd>L-Ctrl</kbd> to be a combination of modifiers (e.g. Ctrl+Shift or Ctrl+Level3) in an effort to reduce finger gymnastics.


# Interesting resources
* There are so many obscure things that are possible with xkb like those briefly mentionned in this article : https://medium.com/@benreaves/keybinding-in-groups-for-linux-938f379648cb but I can't seem to find documentation which lists and explains all those options. [This man page](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/3-XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols/) is a good start.
* [Kinto](https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto) is doing some funky xkb stuff that could be interesting.
